<h1 id="population-paradox">Population Paradox</h1>
<p>Many people enjoy having children around and many think of more children 
as power in the society. These kids will grow up and help their parents at 
the time of need or at least give their parents a sense of tribal power. 
In modern societies, the desire to have many kids might be less but by 
looking at the global population data, one can infer that there is a 
reverse correlation between <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Human-Development-Index">Human Development Index (HDI)</a> of a country and
its population growth. The bitter truth is that <em>we do not need so many
people around</em> and the global resources cannot <em>practically</em> support such
a large number of people. In this article, I will present a few economic 
arguments on the population growth and its impact on business and jobs. </p>
<h2 id="larger-denominator">Larger denominator</h2>
<p>It&#39;s simple. The numerator is the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/gross-domestic-product">economic output</a> of the country (mainly
natural resources in our case) and the denominator is the number of 
people being fed by the economy. I don&#39;t intend to simplify the economic 
distribution problem, which itself a problem that led to wars and global
conflicts and the appearance of 
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/Entries/marx/#ReadCapi">Marxism</a> 
and alike. However, with a 
super-macro lens, one can observe that if the country&#39;s population outpaces
its economic output, people will have less as the denominator will be
large and each person&#39;s cut will be less. Now, we know that there are
those 1% at the top that could complicate the equation. However, if
the top billionaires are factored out, the remnant is the middle class
and a possible worker class. These are the ones that will be hit harder
by a population growth that outpaces the economic output. Ironically,
these are also the ones responsible for enlarging the denominator. 
I&#39;m sorry, but you are eating up from your future and your successors&#39;. 
One can say that the middle and the worker class are also key elements
in improving the numerator (the economic output). But, here is the catch.
Workers must work for the economy to roll. They are the necessary component.
However, they are not sufficient. The top 1% make three key decisions.
First, they choose whether or not to invest and thus create jobs. Second, 
they select the government that regulates the economy. Third, they choose
whether the benefit circulates back to the same economy or the economic 
output is exported to a different jurisdiction. Given these decisions, 
the only choice facing the less privileged (middle, worker classes) 
is to control the population growth. </p>
<h2 id="people-do-not-have-to-work">People do not have to work</h2>
<p>It&#39;s foolish to think everyone has to work and produce to be paid and
it&#39;s quite ignorant to attempt to do that. Think of it this way. 
You have way too many people who are looking for a job (a government job
in our case) and they cannot all be qualified, educated, or useful at all.
The reason is twofold. First, with a small and more interconnected 
community, a well-mannered society <em>can</em> uphold the standard and spread
the culture, the manners, and the basic education to the very small 
offspring sub-population that will grow to enter the job market. 
Second, the state can properly educate them and plan their future. 
Think of a class with 10 students in a school with two classes. 
The management, the services, and the teaching quality can all be 
made to perfection with a limited capital. Now, scale that up to cover
the uncontrolled and unbounded population with a large number of
offspring per household. The ideal school will now host 20 students
per class and has to open 4 classes to barely cover the educational
demand.  The service size is doubled but we can argue that the service
quality has diminished by more than half. We probably still have 
one school principal and one assistant principal and the same 
number of teachers. They simply cannot scale up to the new numbers. </p>
<p>Back to the work demand, in a massively enlarged population with 
rapid growth the economy simply cannot scale up and a good portion
of the population will be useless. Now, why demand them to &quot;pretend&quot;
to work while they can&#39;t? One bizarre example is the 
<a href="https://kuwaittimes.com/article/17631/videos/three-fingerprints/">three fingerprint</a>
model that was introduced in Kuwait in August 2024. This decision is
in the reverse direction. We used to have employees that were not
needed, now we have to make room for them and also increase 
the traffic on the already stressed road system so they can come back
and forth to prove their presence. The correct decision would be
to motivate people out of the work force by solutions such that
creating new business opportunities, introducing the minimum 
income for citizens, and limiting the recruitment of expatriates. </p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>We know that population control is a sensitive matter and it can
interfere with societal values. We are not in favor of rigid population
control policies that make it hard for families to grow. In the 
contrary, these policies result in poorer economic conditions on
the long run. We can always think of discouraging or at least following
a neutral governmental policy towards population growth. Financial 
policies such as giving stipend for each child born for a government
employee does not help. The policy may give a little bit of relief 
to the person but can collectively harm the future of the same 
family. Some people are, unfortunately, under the impression that
raising a child is almost free of charge in social economies like ours.
You get 50 KD (as of 2024) per month for each child (up to seven), 
you get supported basic food items, free education, free healthcare, 
and <em>guaranteed and free</em> college education. These are very nice
policies that we certainly want to keep, 
but can we afford them with a alarmingly high population
growth rate? Perhaps not.  </p>
