<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This book was written based on lecture notes by <a href="https://almohri.io">Hussain Almohri</a> for the course CS126 taught at <a href="https://www.cs.ku.edu.kw">Kuwait University</a>. The notes were written and revised over nine
years of teaching and continue to be updated today. The lessons are designed
to be comprehensible by students with absolutely no background in computing
or even computers. </p>
<p>The author has taken a bottom-up approach, starting with computer hardware and
basics that make up a computer, followed by variable declaration, use of
built-in functions, basic data structures, all the way through conditionals,
repetition, functions, and ending with problem-solving techniques. The use of
complicated programming tricks and problem-solving techniques is avoided to
help the reader go through the mental process of building efficient and
usable programs. When possible, mathematical tricks for simplification and
elegance are not used to reduce confusion. </p>
<p>The course that led up to creating this open book was taught to students who
are overwhelmingly weak in using the English language. Thus, the author has
attempted to simplify the language used in the description of techniques and
language features. </p>
<p>The material in the book gives a tour of the Python language in a
problem-agnostic manner until introducing repetition statements. Examples do
not necessarily follow useful programs, and problem-solving is minimal. When
repetition statements are introduced, the book touches upon simple problems,
often with readily available methods and functions provided by the Python
language itself. For example, students are taught to program a function to
compute the maximum element in a list. This approach helps in enabling
students with a simple testing strategy of comparing their results with the
available functions and methods in Python. </p>
