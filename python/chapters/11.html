<h2 id="sets">Sets</h2>
<p>We can define sets in Python, which resemble the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Set.html">set</a> theory from mathematics. Sets are simple types but are <em>expensive</em> to use and they can slow down the program because of their time-consuming operations for the CPU. To construct a set, one can use the <code>set()</code> function to do so, which can also optionally receive arguments. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">L = [1,2,3,4,4]
S = set(L)
T = {3,4,5,6} 
</code></pre>
<p>Sets do not have orders and do not allow repeated elements. For example, the set <code>S</code> above only contains <code>1,2,3,4</code> in no particular order. One can <em>add</em> values to a set or <em>pop</em> an arbitrary value from a set. When popping from a set, an element is deleted from the set and is returned as a value, which can be either used in an expression or stored in a variable. Note that we cannot add lists, tuples, or sets to a set. When working on sets, we often store numbers or strings in them. Also, because there is no order in a set, we cannot use indexing with sets. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">T.add(7)
x = T.pop()
</code></pre>
<p>Standard set operations are available for Python sets. One can <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Intersection.html">intersect</a> or <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Union.html">union</a> two sets. It&#39;s also possible to compute the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SetDifference.html">difference</a> between two sets. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">A = T &amp; S #T.intersection(S)
B = T | S #T.union(S)
C = T - S #T.difference(S)
D = T ^ S #T.symmetric_difference(S)
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the description of these operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>T &amp; S</code> gives the values that are in both <code>T</code> and <code>S</code>. </li>
<li><code>T | S</code> gives the values that are either in <code>T</code> or <code>S</code>. </li>
<li><code>T - S</code> gives the values that are in <code>T</code> but not in <code>S</code>. </li>
<li><code>T ^ S</code> gives the values that are either in <code>T</code> or <code>S</code> but not in both (exclusive or).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the three basic set operations can either be done using an operator (<code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>^</code>) or using a corresponding set method. 
Try the operations above and see the elements that are stored in <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>. </p>
<h2 id="dictionaries">Dictionaries</h2>
<p>A dictionary is a type that can hold multiple items of key and value pairs. Each item in a dictionary has a key that can be a string (or some other types) and a corresponding value that can be of any type. Dictionaries can be best explained using an example. Suppose that we would like to construct a dictionary to hold the records of a student, including name, GPA, current courses, major, and the number of credits passed so far. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">student = dict() 
student[&#39;name&#39;]    = &#39;Ahmad&#39;
student[&#39;GPA&#39;]     = 3.7
student[&#39;courses&#39;] = {111,126,201,301}
student[&#39;major&#39;]   = &#39;Mathematics&#39; 
student[&#39;credits&#39;] = 60 
</code></pre>
<p>The dictionary above has five items of keys and values. We can similarly add more. We can also delete an item by using the <code>del</code> operator followed by the dictionary name and a valid key. We could also write a for loop that iterates over all the items in a dictionary.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for key, value in student.items():
   print(key,&#39;:&#39;,value) 
</code></pre>
